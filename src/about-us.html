              <p>Previously known as Forrest Airport Shuttle Transfers (or simply FAST), Forrest's Passenger Services is a fresh take on our modest Bribie Island-based passenger transport business, which has recently undergone a few changes after 13 years of providing people with regular, cost-effective transport in and out of the magnificent Moreton Bay region.</p>
              <p>Our new name is a subtle nod to the popular and successful business that came before it, with the founder’s son Chris happy to utilise his years-long experience to build on the strengths of his predecessor, while also seeking out those weaknesses and shortcomings that seem to be opportunities in disguise.</p>
              <p>We’ve faced a raft of challenges over the last few years, and we’re sure to face more. But we’re a determined bunch at Forrest’s, and we couldn’t have done it without all those passengers who gave us a go, especially those who endorse us with their repeat custom and favourable word-of-mouth.</p>
